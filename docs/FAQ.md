# DragonRuby Libsocket FAQ

Welcome to your first and last point for getting your DragonRuby game connected over the internet.

## Who is this library for?

You, that's reading this documentation. You are my target audience. So are your parents and your kindergarten teacher that gave you a failing grade that one time and the next person that purchases your next masterpiece.

## Why was this library made?

I'll be frank, I asked a question about getting Twitch Chat integration to work with DragonRuby in one of the public spaces of DragonRuby's community Discord server. There was no means available at the current time, and I wanted to figure out how to get that working. The core goal of this library is to give you a clean and simple way to get connected.

## What's the catch?

DragonRuby Libsocket will remain open source under the 2-Clause FreeBSD license. That license gives you the freedom to do pretty much anything you want it as long as you include the LICENSE file that came with it in your projects in some for or another and don't claim an unmodified version of it as your property. There are other parts to that license and I'm not trained to offer legal advice.

Any extended requirements of this library beyond the core goal stated above will be evaluated on a case by case basis. I want to make it as free and easy to use as possible for you to build your online connection with but also need to make money like most other adults. Free and open source software are a necessity, in my personal opinion, for improvement and growth in technology but money is required to keep them maintained.

## What will be Free and Open Source and what will cost money?

This is not an extensive list and will be evolving and changing as the need arises.

All source code in this repository will remain free and open source. Community contributions are welcome. I will maintain it and improve it as much as I can so that you can keep making games with it and that it works towards staying as close to the goal stated above as possible. Issues found will be fixed to the best of my ability and at my discretion. I will also attempt to be as transparent as possible and willingly take feedback from the community.

By being open source, you can determine if it will fit your needs for your project by just looking at the code, reading the documentation and asking questions. It currently supports Windows, Mac and Linux and is designed to only integrate with the DragonRuby Toolkit. The extent of my free support will be directly in service of the library and its stated goal above. Maintaining this library will be done on my own accord in my own time with no money exchanged to use or license the library as you see before you.

The paid services I plan to offer:

* Project specific client or server support. A client is what the player will interact with directly (typically the game you've made and sold). A server is typically a central off-site location to store and distribute data related to how your players interact with your game.
* Third party integration support that may or may not require signing license agreements and working with proprietary software or hardware.
* Integrating any kind of security measures into your game that extend this library.

If you need a more specifically tailored solution, please open an issue on this Github repository or contact me through the #oss-cext-libsocket channel on the DragonRuby Discord server. My services and support will be on a case by case basis for the time being. Any games that I develop with this library will be closed source unless stated otherwise. I will not offer any commercial support for open source projects, do reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason that I deem appropriate, and sometimes will make mistakes. I'm human.
